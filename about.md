Why, hello there!

My name is Christian and I'm a Gameplay Programmer currently working at [Darewise Entertainment](http://darewise.com/), developing [Life Beyond](https://www.playlifebeyond.com/).

Previously, I worked on [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/) at [Rockstar North](https://www.rockstarnorth.com/).

I also have a blog, [**[](){} No Man's Lambda**](http://nomanslambda.com/). There, I write about programming, game development and some other things.
